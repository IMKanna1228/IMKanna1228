            "Global warming is the gradual increase of the Earth's average surface temperature. The main component of global warming is the increased emission of greenhouse gases. These gases form a \"blanket\" around Earth that trap energy from the sun. This trapped energy makes the Earth's atmosphere warm, and disturbs the Earth's climate. It is not just the Earth’s temperature that we must worry about in the near future. Climate change has the potential to cause various types of disasters, including hurricanes, famine, drought, and displacement of species. Climate change has the potential to cause all sorts of other risks as well, and it threatens both public health and national security. Despite this, things are looking fairly rosy for the world of climate change, as the Paris Agreement was finally reached in 2015, and there have been promising advancements in renewable energy.\n"
